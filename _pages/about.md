# Welcome to My Page    


I am **Chong Zhang**, a master student in Robotics at ETH Zürich. I am with [Robotic Systems Lab (RSL)](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) for my research. I am currently visiting [LeCAR Lab](https://lecar-lab.github.io/) at CMU. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University.       

I am interested in learning and control for legged robots in the **real world**. I aim high.  

I am a reviewer for RSS (2024), ICRA(2023-2024), IROS (2022-2024), ACC(2022), RA-Letters, ISA Transaction.
